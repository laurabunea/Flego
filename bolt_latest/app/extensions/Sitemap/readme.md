Sitemap
=======

This extension will automatically create XML sitemaps for your Bolt sites. After enabling the extension, go to
`http://example.org/sitemap.xml` to see it.

The bigger search-engines like Google and Bing will automatically pick up your sitemap after a while, but it's always
a good idea to explicitly tell the search engines where to find it. To do so, add the following line to your robots.txt
file:

    Sitemap: http://example.org/sitemap.xml

Obviously, you should replace 'example.org' with the domain name of your website.
